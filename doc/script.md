This video introduces a matkit or matrix tookit. 

Matkit is a set of tools that performs analysis and arbitrary
transformations on mathematical expressions. 

In other words this is a symbolic computer algebra system, not a number
cruncher. Its main purpose is to help engineers in their every day
work.

What exactly does it provide.

First, a terse and expressive language, called matlan. 

This language features juxtaposition, i.e. multiplication operator can
be ommited. 

It also supports overloading. So juxtapostion can be used for both,
scalar and matrix products.

Matlan features an expressive open language for declarations.
